# GamersToolkit
A tool or toolkit for creating and managing rpg characters, dice rolls and results.

## What is this?
This toolkit is just a solution for playing around with some programming techniques. It will not update frequently and will probably take a while to actually work.

## What is the goal here?
The goal here is to create a toolkit for managing rpg characters of different systems, where each system is a seperate component (including specific mechanics and controls) that can be seamlessly plugged into the main program.

## Is there a plan?
Yes, sort of.
1. Fumble around with architecture.
2. Build basic dice mechanics
3. Design and implement systems/system mechanics until no longer funny.
3. Write tests for implementation (repeat for new components).
4. Design basic UI and controls.
5. Slot everything together
5. Build import/export system
